**Network Security Measures**

To enhance the organization's network security posture by implementing layered defense using AWS-native technologies and best practices.

Recommendation:

1. VPC Security Controls
- Use Security Groups to enforce instance-level firewalls (deny-all by default).
- Use Network ACLs for stateless subnet-level filtering.
- Isolate workloads using private subnets and public/private subnet segregation.

2. AWS Network Firewall
- Provision an AWS Network Firewall in your VPC to analyze quad-directional traffic.
- Use stateful rules for protocol filtering and application layer inspection.

3. VPC Flow Logs and Traffic Analysis
- Enable VPC Flow Logs and send data to CloudWatch Logs or S3 and Athena for query.
- Use GuardDuty to analyze VPC Flow Logs and detect suspicious traffic.

**Additional Practices**

- Implement AWS PrivateLink for secure service-to-service communication.
- Enable Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall** to block malicious domains.
- Use CloudFront + AWS WAF for edge protection and rate limiting.
