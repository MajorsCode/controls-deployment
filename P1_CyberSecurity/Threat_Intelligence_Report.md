# Threat Intelligence Report - 17 June 2025

1. Potential Attacks

Common attacks associated with unpatched, web application vulnerabilities:

- Remote Code Execution: Allows attackers to run arbitrary code on the host system.
- SQL Injection: Malicious SQL queries can expose or manipulate database contents.
- Cross-Site Scripting: Injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- Privilege Escalation: Exploits weaknesses to gain elevated access (e.g., root or admin).
- Lateral Movement: Once inside the network, attackers pivot to other systems to expand control.


2. How a Vulnerability Can Provide Network Access

A typical attack sequence:

1. RCE Exploitation – The attacker leverages an unpatched vulnerability in the web application.
2. Reverse Shell Access – They gain shell-level control of the server using tools like `nc` or `bash`.
3. Credential Theft or Metadata Exploitation – AWS instance metadata (e.g., IAM role creds) can be stolen.
4. Lateral Movement – The attacker moves within the VPC or internal subnets to reach other services.
5. Data Exfiltration – Sensitive data from S3, RDS, or EFS is extracted and transmitted offsite.


3. Preventive Measures

To mitigate and prevent similar security incidents:

- Patch Management: Regularly apply OS and software updates using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager.
- Web Application Firewall: Blocks common exploits (SQLi, XSS) at the edge.
- Amazon GuardDuty: Continuously monitors for threats like unusual API activity or port scanning.
- AWS Security Hub: Aggregates findings from GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, and more for centralized security insights.
- Static Code Analysis (SCA/SAST): Integrate tools like SonarQube, CheckOv, or GitHub CodeQL into CI/CD pipelines and Ide to detect vulnerabilities before deployment. (Shift-left)
