**Docker Security Best Practices**

1. Use Minimal Base Images
Use lightweight images such as `alpine` or `distroless` to reduce the attack surface and limit unnecessary packages that have the potential to be exploited.

2. Run Containers as Non-Root
Avoid using the `root` user inside containers. Running as a non-root prevents privilege escalation in the event of a container compromise.

3. Avoid Storing Secrets in Images
Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or secrets in Dockerfiles or environment variables. AWS Secrets Manager should be integrated as a tool to prevent secret compromising.

4. Use Multi-Stage Builds
Multi-stage builds reduce image size by separating the build environment from the final image.

5. Regularly Scan Images for Vulnerabilities
Use security scanners Amazon Inspector to detect known vulnerabilities in images before deployment.
