**Kubernetes Security Configuration**

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC restricts user and service account actions in the cluster by assigning roles to specific identities. This helps enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users and services can only perform actions they are explicitly authorized for.

2. Pod Security Context
`securityContext` defines privilege and access control settings for a pod or container, such as running as a non-root user, disallowing privilege escalation, and using read-only file systems.

3. Network Policies
Kubernetes Network Policies control how pods communicate with each other and with external endpoints. By default, all traffic is allowed, but you can define policies to restrict ingress and egress traffic for specific pods or namespaces.
